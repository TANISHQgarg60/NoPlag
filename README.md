# Advanced Plagiarism & AI Detection System


---

## 🚀 Project Overview

An interactive Streamlit dashboard that detects:

* **Cross‑document plagiarism** using transformer embeddings and cosine similarity
* **Self‑plagiarism** by comparing sentences within the same document
* **AI‑generated content** with lightweight linguistic features

This app empowers users to analyze text files or pasted text, visualize similarity distributions, highlight matches, and export detailed reports.

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Compare Two Texts**: Flag sentences in a target text that closely match a source text.
* **Self‑Plagiarism Detection**: Identify repeated or overly similar sentences within a single document.
* **AI Content Detection**: Estimate the probability that text was generated by an AI model based on phrase usage, length uniformity, and vocabulary diversity.
* **Interactive Visualizations**:

  * Histogram of cosine similarity scores
  * Gauge chart for AI‑generation probability
  * Inline HTML highlighting of matched sentences
* **Configuration Controls**:

  * Adjust similarity threshold via sidebar slider
  * Toggle on/off distribution plots and text highlights
* **File Upload & Export**:

  * Upload `.txt` files for bulk analysis
  * Download CSV reports of detected matches

## 💡 Usage Tips

* **Batch Processing**: Upload multiple `.txt` files for rapid comparison.
* **Threshold Tuning**: Lower the similarity threshold to catch more subtle matches (risk of false positives).
* **AI Detection Confidence**: Interpreted as Low (<40%), Medium (40–70%), High (>70%).
